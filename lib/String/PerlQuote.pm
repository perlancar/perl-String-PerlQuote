# ABSTRACT: Quote a string as Perl does

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 double_quote($str) => STR

Quote or encode C<$str> to the Perl double quote (C<">) literal representation
of the string. Example:

 say double_quote("a");        # => "a"     (with the quotes)
 say double_quote("a\n");      # => "a\n"
 say double_quote('"');        # => "\""
 say double_quote('$foo');     # => "\$foo"

This code is taken from C<quote()> in L<Data::Dump>. Maybe I didn't look more
closely, but I couldn't a module that provides a function to do something like
this. L<String::Escape>, for example, provides C<qqbackslash> but it does not
escape C<$>.

=head2 single_quote($str) => STR

Like C<double_quote> but will produce a Perl single quote literal representation
instead of the double quote ones. In single quotes, only literal backslash C<\>
and single quote character C<'> are escaped, the rest are displayed as-is, so
the result might span multiple lines or contain other non-printable characters.

 say single_quote("Mom's");    # => 'Mom\'s' (with the quotes)
 say single_quote("a\\");      # => 'a\\"
 say single_quote('"');        # => '"'
 say single_quote("\$foo");    # => '$foo'
